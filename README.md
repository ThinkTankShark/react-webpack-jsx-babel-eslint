### What's in it?

Just a simple [ClientApp.jsx](./js/ClientApp.jsx), [webpack.config.js](./webpack.config.js), [index.html](./index.html) file, [Airbnb ESlint Style](./eslintrc) and [server.js](./server.js).

### To run

* You'll need to have [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed in your system.
* Fork and clone the project:

```
> $ git clone https://github.com/ThinkTankShark/react-webpack-jsx-babel-eslint
```

Then install the dependencies:

```
> $ npm install
```

Install webpack and the development server:
